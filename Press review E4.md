- Trump : “greatest political movement of all time.”
- the Republican’s political comeback = triumph against “wokeism”
- Many of Europe’s far right politicians views Trump as :
	- transatlantic ally 
	- who promotes the same conservative Christian values
	- shares the same disdain for progressive politics
- hope normalize their anti-immigrant, nation-first rhetoric.
- “Congratulations President Trump… Never stop, always keep fighting and win elections,” **Geert Wilders, the populist leader of the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV)**, wrote on X on November 6
- **Alternative for Germany (AfD) co-leader Alice Weidel** also offered her congratulations and declared that it was not “woke Hollywood” but rather the “working American people” that decided the election
- For **Hungary’s Viktor Orbán**, it was a “much needed victory for the world.”
- To summarize, the election of Trump will not only have large influence on american minds but also impacts the far right opinions in Europe by normalizing and amplifying ideas
- however, the right political party in europe remains extremely fragmented which holds back the possibility of the extreme parties to take full control,
- quote concerning the disparities in far right opinions : « The closer you zoom in, the more nuanced it becomes »
