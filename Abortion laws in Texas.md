(Neveah Crain's case, cf poly "The law is on their side")
## To what extent do restrictive abortion laws in Texas impact patient care and providers's responsibility?


Restrictive abortion laws in Texas impact patient care and providers' responsibilities by creating delays in the treatments because fearing legal repercussions among the medical team. Nevaeh Crain's tragic death illustrates the severe consequences of these laws. Despite her critical condition, doctors hesitated to intervene due to legal restrictions for fetal heartbeat detection. This delay prioritized compliance with the law over the well-being of Nevaeh Crain whose health rapidly deteriorated, tragically resulting in her death.

Such laws force healthcare providers to choose between following the law and their duty to save lives. The exception that allows abortion only when the mother’s life is "explicitly" at risk is unclear, this grey area makes it hard for doctors to know when they can or cannot provide the necessary intervention to save the life of the women. It is the fear of serious punishment, like jail time, that stops many doctors from making quick medical decisions, even when patients are in danger.

It is hard for families to seek justice because of the legal system. For example, in Nevaeh Crain’s case, her family cannot sue the medical staff without proving "willful and wanton negligence," which is very difficult. This law demonstrates how the system puts patient care below politics. It is therefore difficult for patients to trust the healthcare system.
