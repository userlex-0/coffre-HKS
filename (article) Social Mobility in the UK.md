- **Date:** April 7, 2022

## Key Points

### Definition of Social Mobility
- **Social Mobility:** Doing better or worse in terms of lifetime outcomes than one's parents.
- **UK's Position:** The UK ranks near the bottom of the international league table for both social mobility and inequality.
- **Comparison:** Only the U.S. and Switzerland have lower social mobility than the UK.

### Current State of Social Mobility in the UK
- **Performance:** The UK performs poorly on most social mobility metrics compared to the rest of Europe.
- **Impact of Covid-19:** The pandemic has exacerbated social inequality, with lower-income jobs being more affected by lockdowns.
- **Regional Differences:** The North of England has experienced harsher conditions than the South, particularly in employment and education.

### Causes of Poor Social Mobility
- **Education Transmission:** Strong transmission of educational advantages from one generation to the next.
- **Regional Income Differences:** Significant income disparities between regions, with higher-paying jobs concentrated in the South.
- **Tax System:** The UK's tax system may be less progressive compared to countries like Denmark, Finland, and Norway.

### Improving Social Mobility
- **Policy Areas for Improvement:**
  1. **Geographical Inequality:** Increase public investment in less well-off regions.
  2. **Education:** Focus on equalizing opportunities and improving access for children from lower-income households.
  3. **Apprenticeships and Retraining:** Retarget programs toward people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
  4. **Digital Access:** Ensure high-quality digital access for less wealthy households, especially in remote locations.

### Role of the Corporate World
- **Internal Actions:** Companies should consider social mobility as part of their diversity initiatives, looking at the social backgrounds of employees and broadening their talent pool.
- **Investment:** Companies should invest in underinvested communities, such as infrastructure projects in the North of England or social housing.
- **ESG Investing:** Focus more on the social impact (S) of companies, not just the environmental impact (E). Companies with a positive social impact should see flows from ESG funds, reducing their cost of capital and allowing for more investment in social impact initiatives.

## Conclusion
The UK faces significant challenges in social mobility, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and rising energy costs. However, there are clear policy and corporate actions that can be taken to improve social mobility and reduce inequality.
