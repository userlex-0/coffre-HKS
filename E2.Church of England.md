### I/a. John Wycliff (1328-1384) & the lollards
- 14th century 
- John Wycliff = Oxford Theologian
- Criticised the lack of knowledge of the Scriptures (Latin / misinterpretation) 
	- => rise of humanism ?
- Scriptures above the Church > questioned the clergy’s and the Pope’s abilities

- Calvin’s most famous student : John KNOX, founder of the Presbyterian Church

### II/a. A Highly-Political Divorce
- Catholic country since the 6th century
- Henry VIII ≠ the Church :
	- a European network
	- Spain / France
	- a power against Henry’s authority
	- taxes paid to the church

		- title of Fidei Defensor
	- Supreme Head of the Church of England :

		- dilemma between his Catholic faith and the Protestant influence of his circle (Anne Boleyn / Thomas Cromwell / Thomas Cranmer / Parliament)
- **The English Bible**
	- very important aspect : the reference for religious customs
	- should not be in Latin but in any language people could read or understand
	- Groundbreaking -> priest had been the only ones to read the Bible
	- Now, individual access to God (bef. via priests)
	- Translation of Bible in english -> King James Bible (1611)
	
#### c. The Dissolution of the Monasteries

	- Oath of loyalty to the monarch, as Supreme Governor
	- Heresy laws repealed
	- Attendance at church and use of the 1559 Book of Common Prayer made compulsory 
	- Acts passed without the consent of churchmen = constitutional first

	- ![[Pasted image 20241119095155.png]] 
- **Elizabeth I versus Mary Stuart: royal Cousins & Rival Queens**
